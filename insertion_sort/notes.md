# Insertion Sort Notes

## [Python](./python/insertion_sort.py)
Implementing this algorithm in python was pretty simple, the only struggle I really had was reasoning how to number the indexes for the for loop compared to the algorithm in the book (arrays start at 1 and go to n in the book, python is of course 0 to n-1). However, that didn't take long to figure out. Coding in python is pretty nice. Even if I have to look a couple things up, it doesn't take long to write.

## [Java](./java/insertion_sort.java)
Implementing this in Java was pretty difficult, mostly since I'm still learning Java. The main issue I had was confusion about copying an array. At first I intended to have the `sort()` function return the sorted array and assign that array to a new array. However, upon doing so I found that the original array `A` would be sorted as well. I still don't fully understand it, but the `sort()` function changes `A`. I then tried to copy `A` to a new array and then sort it, but `A` still ended up getting sorted. As I understand it now, arrays are objects, and the variable assigned to an array is actually a pointer to this object (the same thing happens for classes). When I set the new array equal to `A`, I'm just pointing to the same array. As for why the `sort()` method alters `A`, I think its because by using `A` as the input of the method, acting on `A`, and returning `A`, I'm actualling acting on that same pointer. This threw me off compared to something like what I'd find in python where the scope of the method is different and as such its essentially a different variable. 

My first solution was to just print the original array, sort `A` (with `sort()` now returning void), and then print the sorted array. This works, but its not what I wanted to do. In the end, I had the `sort()` method use `clone()` to clone the original array.

Also, for printing the arrays, I originally use a while and for loop to do it:

```java
int i = 0;
String version = "Original: [";
while(i < 2) {
    System.out.print(version);
    for(int j = 0; j < A.length; j++) {
        if(j < A.length-1){
            System.out.print(A[j] + ",");
        } else {
            System.out.print(A[j]);
        }
    }
    System.out.print("]\n");
    sort(A);
    version = "  Sorted: [";
    i ++;
}
```

This works just fine, but `Array.toString()` works much better.

## [Rust](./rust/src/main.rs)
Rust has taken the most time and effort to implement because I have no prior experience with it whatsoever and learning the fundamentals has been more of an undertaking compared to any other language I've learned. It seems like Rust is very controlled language, and some of the concepts in Rust took me a bit to understand (and I don't fully understand them all yet), e.g. variable types, mutability, ownership, etc. However, the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/) has been an incredibly useful resource for learning, and it's been very helpful in convincing me of why one might want to use Rust. It's an interesting language and I'm having fun learning it.

For the rust implementation of the insertion sort algorithm, there were a few things that really tripped me up. First of all, the `rand` crate (i.e. library or package as it's called in other languages) was a bit confusing to figure out for generating a vector of random integers. At first I tried using arrays, but learned about vectors instead and found it easier to accomplish with vectors. In fact, the book said that, when in doubt, use vectors instead. As I understand it, in Rust, vectors are stored on the heap, and arrays are stored on the stack in memory. That fact is more important with objects whose length changes dynamically, which wasn't really important here. In the end, I opted to write a function to output a random vector of length `N`:

```rust
fn gen_rand_arr<const N: usize>() -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
    (0..N).map(|_| rng.gen_range(0..100)).collect()
}
```

At this point I more or less understand what's going on here, but the "<>" thing between the function name and the argument parentheses still confuses me. At least I know it has something to do with "generics" in Rust, but that's something I still need to learn more about. 

The other thing that really tripped me up was the indexing for the loops in the insertion sort algorithm. I got it to work, but I'm not sure whether my solution is a proper one or not. The crux of the issues stems from the fact that the index for the for loop must be a `usize` type (i.e. a type of unsigned integer), but with 0-indexing for arrays/vectors, and the way insertion sort is written, `j` would end up needing to take a value of `-1`, at least in the way I've been writing it. I found workarounds most of the time (`j as usize` would convert from `int32` to `usize` when necessary), but really ran into problems in the conditions on the while loop. While one condition would be `j >= 0` (again, 0-indexing, allowing `j` to be `0`), the other would use `j` to access the vector being sorted. Translating from `j = -1int32` to `usize` would result in an overflow, making `i = 18446744073709551615`. To solve this issue, I realized I could make the `A[j] > key` condition conditional on whether `j` was positive or not:

```rust
while (j >= 0) & (if j >= 0 {a[j as usize] > key} else {false}) {...}
```

I found this pretty neat as a solution to this issue. I would still like to see if there are other ways to write this part though.
