# Algorithms or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Just Write Code

Hello! I'm Hayden Boline, a data scientist, and

## What is This?
I'm a data scientist (recent grad, at least), and I've wanted to get a firmer grasp on the computer science side of what I do. I've also wanted to learn some other progamming languages, as well as strengthen my understanding of ones I already have experience with. I've tried some different ways of going about this, and I think I've finally found the way that works best for me. 

Here, as I read the 4th edition of the [CLRS book on algorithms](http://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046305/introduction-to-algorithms/), I'm implementing the algorithms I come across in the book in 3 (maybe 4) languages: **Python**, **Java**, and **Rust** (and maybe **Julia**?). The idea is to learn about algorithms and data structures, while learning/strengthening my understanding in these languages by implementing them. The book is very long, so I don't know that I'll ever fully do it. For each chapter, I will do some of the exercises and problems, and include my solutions for each chapter here as well.

I decided to put this on github for 3 reasons: (1) I want to take advantage of version control and force myself to use git regularly, (2) to make it public to motivate myself to keep working on it, and (3) please look at this potential employers, look at my code! look at my passion! I want/need a job! --> and, oh wow, my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haydenboline/)!

## A Bit More Info

I chose Python and Java are two of the most popular languages in the world, both expose me to different paradigms of programming, and for the data-related jobs I'm seeking out, both are very important be it in data science, data engineering, or machine learning engineering. 

For a third language, while I could've gone for more popular languages like C/C++ or Go, I chose Rust because, while it's not widely used, from what I've learned about it it has a lot of advantages over other popular languages and its growing in popularity and use (e.g. Microsoft's recent interest in Rust). The other advantage of Rust for me personally is it is a very difficult language to learn at the start. I think this will be beneficial to me whether Rust becomes more popular down the line.

I haven't yet decided whether I will or not, but I'd also like to consider implementing things in Julia as well. Julia has been growing in the data science sphere, and I've had chances to use it throughout my time in college. It's a great language and I'd like to get back into using it as it grows. For now, I may just implement things in Julia here-and-there so I don't spread myself too thin.
